# Silly Book Wyrms
Minecraft Resource Pack compatible with the Defiled Lands mod by Lykrast and RLCraft modpack by Shivaxi.

Replaces all Book Wyrms (gold ones too!) with much sillier TBH Creatures!

## So Silly!

Resource Pack is, of course, complete with silly sounds:
+ Yippee!
+ Woahh :3
+ Yaayyy!<br/><br/>

*(Do NOT unzip BookWyrms.zip, simply place it in your **../minecraft/resourcepacks** directory)*

<sub>All credit goes to Lykrast for making the amazing Defiled Lands mod, and to Shivaxi for inspiring me with his insane modpack.<sub/>
