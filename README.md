# Silly Book Wyrms
Minecraft Resource Pack compatible with the Defiled Lands mod by Lykrast and RLCraft modpack by Shivaxi[^1].<br/>
Replaces all Book Wyrms (gold ones too!) with much sillier TBH Creatures!<br/>

So Silly!<br/><br/>

Resource Pack is, of course, complete with silly sounds such as "yippee!"<br/>
[^1]All credit goes to Lykrast for making the amazing Defiled Lands mod, and to Shivaxi for inspiring me with his insane modpack.
